# Meme Downloader (Linux version)
A Shell/NodeJS app that allows you to download memes from Reddit automatically

## Experimental
This script was not really fully tested. **NEVER** run it as root, and check its code so you won't make your system die.
It was tested on an Arch Linux system. (i use arch btw)

## Installation and usage
- Install Node.JS and NPM.
- Check which command starts up Node.JS. Type `node` and `nodejs` on your terminal and check which one works.
  If it works through `nodejs`, you have to make an alias. Type on your terminal: `alias node="nodejs"`.
  This will make a temporary alias (which won't be kept on closing your bash session).
- Clone this repository, or download a release version if possible.
- `cd` into the repository and run `start.sh` which will download the required libraries and will start the download process
