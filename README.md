# Meme Downloader
A Microsoft Batch/NodeJS app that allows you to download memes from Reddit automatically

## Installation
- Make sure you have NodeJS and the Node Package Manager (NPM) installed.
- Clone or download this repository.
- All dependencies are installed automatically when you run `start.bat`.

## Usage
Run `start.bat` - it will make sure all dependencies are up to date, then it will download memes indefinitely, until the window is closed.

## Windows
If you've downloaded the zip file for Windows from the `Releases` page, open the `.exe` file to run the program. The executable still requires you to have NodeJS and NPM installed on your system, so you will need to do that before running it.

## Experimental Linux version
A Linux version of Meme Downloader is at the `dev-linux` branch. https://github.com/DogeSoftware/meme-downloader/tree/dev-linux
